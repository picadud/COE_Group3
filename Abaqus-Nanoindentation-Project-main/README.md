# Abaqus-Nanoindentation-Project

## Welcome to the Abaqus Nanoindentation Project. This readme.md file contains information on how one can start running multiple Abaqus test runs simultaneously. 

### The following project can be done using two different approaches. The first option is implementing a loss function and ML algorithm to predict several points on the force-displacement curve explained in Stage 3-1. The second approach is to use iterative calibration using a direct regression model shown in Stage 3-2.
